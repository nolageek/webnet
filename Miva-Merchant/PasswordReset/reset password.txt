To reset the password we use a file called pre-provide.xml for version 5 stores and pre-provide.dat for version 4 stores.

Upload this file inside the Mivadata data directory parallel to the merchant2 folder. Then go to the admin log in page and log in as :
username : temp
password: temp

Then you can go in reset any of the user's passwords you want. Then log in as that user and delete the temp user.

Attached are the two files.
