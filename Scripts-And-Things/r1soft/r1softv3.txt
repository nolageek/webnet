downgrading r1soft

As a temporary workaround, please downgrade to the 4.2.1.17820 agent and the backups should work again.

1. Edit your /etc/yum.repos.d/r1soft.repo (or wherever you download your RPMs from) and comment out the baseurl and add a line below it eg:
Code:
#baseurl=http://repo.r1soft.com/yum/stable/$basearch/
baseurl=http://repo.r1soft.com/release/4.2.1/2012236/yum/stayble/$basearch/

2. Delete /var/cache/yum/r1soft/repomd.xml so yum doesn't ignore the older files that it finds

3. Then remove the new agent files:
Code:
yum remove serverbackup*
yum remove r1soft*
rm /usr/sbin/r1soft -rf

4. re-install the agent from the old repo:
yum install r1soft-enterprise-agent
r1soft-setup --get-module

5. Start the agent and r-aquire the key from your CDP server and you should be back in business.
